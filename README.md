🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project is part of my Oasis Infobytes Internship. It focuses on classifying iris flowers into species using Machine Learning.

📌 Project Overview

The Iris dataset contains measurements of three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the species of a flower based on its features.

Features used:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

Target variable: Species of the flower

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

🔹 Steps Performed

Data Loading: Loaded the Iris dataset using Pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Checked dataset info, missing values, and basic statistics.

Data Visualization: Created scatter plots and pairplots to understand feature relationships.

Model Building: Trained a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict flower species.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated accuracy and performance using train-test split.

📊 Key Insights

Petal length and petal width are the most important features for classifying iris species.

The KNN model achieved high accuracy on the dataset.
