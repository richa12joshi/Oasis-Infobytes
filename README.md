Oasis Infobytes Data Science Internship Tasks

This repository contains the projects I completed during my Oasis Infobytes Internship. Each task is based on real-world problems and solved using Python and Machine Learning.

ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

A classic Machine Learning project where I trained a model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their measurements.

Used scikit-learn and visualized the data for better understanding.

ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Spam Mail Prediction

Built a Machine Learning model to classify emails as Spam or Not Spam.

Used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like CountVectorizer and Naive Bayes classifier.

Helps in filtering out unwanted emails effectively.

ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Unemployment Analysis in India (Data Science)

Analyzed unemployment data during Covid-19.

Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning and visualization.

Found clear patterns showing the spike in unemployment during mid-2020.
