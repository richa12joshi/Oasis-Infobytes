🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project is part of my Oasis Infobytes Internship. The goal is to classify iris flowers into their species using Machine Learning.

📌 Project Overview

The Iris dataset contains measurements of three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The aim is to predict the species of a flower based on its features.

Features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

Target:

Species of the flower

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python • Pandas • NumPy • Matplotlib • Seaborn • Scikit-learn

🔹 Steps Performed

Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and checked for missing values.

Visualized the data with scatter plots and pairplots.

Built a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict species.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy and train-test split.

📊 Key Insights

Petal length and petal width are the most important features for classification.

The KNN model achieved high accuracy on the dataset.
